Todays Todos:

* List of connected clients on the server side, properly, not just loose nodes within the node-tree
    * Only send updates of movement and rotation to clients that have already initialiezed the whole node tree of connected clients, otherwise the nodes with the uid as name cannot be found -> error (hopefully solves itself with the better connected client list)





* ???((Maybe Downloadable maps from connecting server)) -> https://godotengine.org/qa/903/how-to-save-a-scene-at-run-timesyncServerInfo
